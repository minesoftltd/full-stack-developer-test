# Full-Stack Recruitment Test
Thank you for taking the time to complete Minesoft's full-stack developer test. This test is designed to provide us with a better understanding of your level as a developer.  
  
This test is divided into two sections: 
1. Coding Test
2. Follow-up Questions

## Submitting Your Work
The test should be submitted by emailing us a link to a public GitHub repository containing your work.  
Answers to the follow-up questions should be located in a FOLLOWUP.md markdown file within the project.  
Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the coding test as you like. We appreciate that people lead busy lives and would guide you to spend no more than 2-3 hours on a submission.

## Coding Test
### Technology Requirements
- Use the Laravel PHP framework.
- Use Vue 3 on the frontend.

3. As a user, I can create, view, update, mark as "completed", and delete `TodoItems` within a `TodoList`
4. As a user, I can filter, sort, and search `TodoItems` by creation date, due date, and priority
5. As a user, I can share a `TodoList` with another user, granting them read-only or edit access
6. As a user, I receive push notifications for approaching `TodoItem` due dates

## Follow-up Questions
